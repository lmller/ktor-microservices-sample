Sample application for my talk
[Microservices with Kotlin and Ktor](https://speakerdeck.com/lmller/microservices-with-kotlin-and-ktor)

To see it in action, start all servers:
```
  ./gradlew warehouse:run
  ./gradlew orders:run
  ./gradlew configurator:run
```

You should then be able to see and use the example's frontend at http://localhost:8080/
